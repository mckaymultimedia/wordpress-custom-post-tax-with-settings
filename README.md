# wordpress-custom-post-tax-with-settings
 
WordPress plugin to create a custom post type with an associated taxonomy and a settings page with 5 fields involves several steps. Here's a simplified example to get you started:

    Create a folder for the plugin in the WordPress wp-content/plugins directory.

    Inside the plugin folder, create a main PHP file (e.g., custom-plugin.php) and add the following code:

This code registers a custom post type, taxonomy, and a settings page with 5 fields. You can modify the labels, slugs, and field names to match your needs.

    Upload the plugin folder to the wp-content/plugins directory of your WordPress installation.

    Activate the plugin from the WordPress admin dashboard.

    You can now create custom posts of the new custom post type and configure the plugin's settings on the "Custom Plugin Settings" page.

This is a basic example. Depending on the specific requirements, you may need to add more features, validation, and security measures to the plugin.
